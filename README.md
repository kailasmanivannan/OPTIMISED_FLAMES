<h2>
This is a classic 90's games where a user and user's crush name are given as input.There relationship status is displayed as output(fun ya).
Unlike using if/else after evaluation(only for values from 1 to 20),its optimised using string fucntions (cpp STL) and a different algorithm is applied on 
string "flames" to find out the answer.This optimised code can handle cases with value(unsimilar charcters in both the names) greater than 
20 without if/else rather using basic mathematical calculations.

jump in... download it... compile it... and run it to see your status with your crush :) 

complier used : gcc 8.2.0 (*important*).

PS : to complie in linux change every system("cls") to system("clear").

HAPPY CODING.
